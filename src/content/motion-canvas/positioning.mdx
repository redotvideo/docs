# Positioning

_Note: These docs were adopted from the original
[Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/docs/) docs_

Motion Canvas uses a Cartesian coordinate system. Its origin is located in the
center of the scene, with the x-axis going to the right and the y-axis going
down.

## Transform

All nodes are positioned relative to their parents. This means that any
transformations applied to the parent are also applied to its children. The
transform of each node consists of the following properties:

### `Node.position`

<hr />

### `Node.scale`

<hr />

### `Node.rotation`

<hr />

## Absolute transform

Each of the basic transform properties has a dedicated helper method that
operates in world space.

This can be helpful, for instance, when we need to match the transforms of two
nodes located within different parents. Consider the following example:

```tsx
const circleA = createRef<Node>();
const circleB = createRef<Node>();

view.add(
  <>
    <Node position={[200, 100]}>
      <Circle
        position={[0, 100]}
        ref={circleA}
        width={20}
        height={20}
        fill={'white'}
      />
    </Node>
    <Circle ref={circleB} width={10} height={10} fill={'red'} />
  </>,
);

circleB().absolutePosition(circleA().absolutePosition());
```

We access the absolute position (position in world space) of `circleA` and
assign it as the absolute position of `circleB`. This will move the `circleB`
right on top of `circleA`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Note that we still need to set the `absolutePosition` of `circleB` and not just
> the `position`. It may seem redundant since `circleB` is a direct child of the
> scene view. But the local space of the scene view is **not** the same as the
> world space.

All available world-space properties are listed below:

### `Node.absolutePosition`

<hr />

### `Node.absoluteScale`

<hr />

### `Node.absoluteRotation`

<hr />

## Matrices

For more advanced uses, nodes expose all the matrices necessary to map vectors
from one space to another. For example, the helper properties described above
could be reimplemented using the `worldToParent` and `localToWorld` matrices:

```ts
// getting the absolute position:
node.absolutePosition();
// same as:
Vector2.zero.transformAsPoint(node.localToWorld());

// setting the absolute position:
node.absolutePosition(vector);
// same as:
node.position(vector.transformAsPoint(node.worldToParent()));
```

The available matrices include:

### `Node.localToWorld`

<hr />

### `Node.worldToLocal`

<hr />

### `Node.localToParent`

<hr />

### `Node.worldToParent`

<hr />
