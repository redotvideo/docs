# Filters and Effects

_Note: These docs were adopted from the original
[Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/docs/) docs_

Because Motion Canvas is built on top of the Browser's 2D Rendering Context, we
can make use of several canvas operations that are provided by the Browser.

## Filters

Filters let you apply various effects to your nodes. You can find all available
filters on
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/filter).

Every node has a `filters` property containing an array of
[filters](/api/2d/partials#Functions) that will be applied to the node. You can
declare this array yourself, or use the `filters` property to configure
individual filters. Both ways are shown in the following example:



```tsx
// snippet Filters Property


export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  view.fill('#141414');

  const iconRef = createRef## Masking and composite operations

Composite operations define how the thing we draw (source) interacts with what
is already on the canvas (destination). Among other things, it allows us to
define complex masks. MDN has a
[great visualisation of all available composite operations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation#operations).

You can create a mask by treating one node as the "masking" / "stencil" layer,
and another node as the "value" layer. The mask layer will define if the value
layer will be visible or not. The value layer will be what's actually visible in
the end.

Any of the following composite operations can be used to create a mask:
`source-in`, `source-out`, `destination-in`, and `destination-out`. There is
also a `xor` operation which can be helpful if you want two value layers that
hide each other on overlap. Use the dropdown below to browse all examples.







## Cached nodes

Both filters and composite operations require a cached
[`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node). Filters can set it automatically, while
composite operations require you to set it explicitly on an ancestor
[`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node) (usually the parent node).

A cached [`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node) and its children are rendered on an
offscreen canvas first, before getting added to the main scene.  
For filters this is needed because they are applied to the entire canvas. By
creating a new canvas and moving the elements that should get affected by the
filters over, applying filters to the entire "new" canvas, and then moving back
the result, you effectively only apply the filters to the moved elements.

To turn a [`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node) into a cached node, simply pass the
[`cache`](/api/2d/components/NodeProps/#cache) property

```tsx
<Node cache>...</Node>
// or
<Node cache={true}>...</Node>
```

All components inherit from [`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node), so you can set
the cache on all of them.
