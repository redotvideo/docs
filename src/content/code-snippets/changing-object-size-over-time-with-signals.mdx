# Changing Object Sizes with Signals

You can use signals to change values in your animation over time. Below you can
find a example that uses signals to change the size of a circle over time.

```tsx


export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const circleSize = createSignal(50); // initial size of 50

  yield view.add(
    <>
      </>,
  );

  yield* circleSize(200, 2); // change size to 200 over two seconds
});
```
